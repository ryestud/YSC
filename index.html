        <div class="col-12 light-panel">
          <p class="lead">Our current education system was created to satisfy the needs of an Industrial Age not those of the 21st Century. Our society from the latter part of the 1800s to mid-1960s focused on educating everyone to meet the literacy requirements in reading, writing, and math. The problem we face as a society is that our legacy education systems no longer fit the individual learning needs and haven’t since the 1960s that don’t include computers. <br> <br>
                          Y STEM and Chess Inc. is a 501C3 organization formed to provide a solution to this problem with a focus on those disenfranchised children in our society that have been written off because of social and economic factors. Y STEM and Chess Inc was started by someone who was classified as not “educatable” by the system, but thanks to the determination of he and his family, achieved academic success with a BA in Philosophy and MS degree in Cybersecurity. He was not considered “educatable” above a 3rd or 4th-grade level by the school system. When forming the organization, the founder also recruited people with experience to solve the problem to help develop the YSC learning program. The first is a public school math teacher with over 30 years of experience in low income areas. </p>

            <br>YSC is based on mastering three foundation building blocks of 21st Century learning.  The first is Chess, second is Math, the third is Coding and the fourth is mentoring. Let’s take them in reverse order.<br><br>
             A distinguishing factor in those that find success in STEM are those that have mentors. The students need to have the positive affirmation of being told that they can do STEM. That they have the aptitude to be successful. When things get hard and they struggle with a difficult subject, a mentor tells the students that it is common. Student needs to hear that everyone struggles but those that succeed are those that push through.<br><br>
             Next up is, Coding is part of the universal language of the 21st Century. If you don’t have the ability in these “languages,” you are illiterate in today’s world and for the foreseeable future. That’s because it is the basis of interaction with the world of technology. <br><br>
             Math in its many forms is the foundation of quantifying and qualifying problems and their solutions. It is also an integral element of Coding. Without a foundation in math, today is the same as not having a vocabulary or being able to read and write in the last century.  Everything we do in some way or another has a connection to math. <br><br>
             Finally, there is Chess and what qualities of Mastery it unlocks.  This is an ancient game—developed by India, and some say Persian, royalty around the 6th Century. We started our program with mastering the game of chess because it is the most efficient way to rapidly learn the critical mental skills required to participate in the world of STEM as well as functioning in the 21st Century. <br><br>

            <br><p>“Mastery” has to do with content in the form of clearly defined (quantified and qualified) Learning Objectives comprised of Tasks, Skills, and Knowledge that must be mastered (100%) before moving on to the next Learning Objective. Anything less than 100% is not Mastery. The Mastery process of learning is individually focused and personally relevant to that student. Testing is primarily a tool to determine if the Learning Objective has been Mastered, and if not what additional support the individual needs to achieve it. Put simply, it is a go/no go testing threshold. The objective is to ensure there are no holes in each student’s learning foundation.</p>
